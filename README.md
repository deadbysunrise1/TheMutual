# TheMutual
The Mutual at its core is a basic investment instrument for Cryptocurrency markets. In this paper we will discuss in detail why it was created, how does it work, uses of TMF and the future of this project.

WHY?
Mutual is an effort by a team of cryptocurrency veterans to harness the power of pooled financing. In 2018 we saw a boom in ICO sector, people made crazy gains and people lost savings of their lifetime. Some happened gradually and some in the blink of an eye, referred as “rugpull” these days. Since then, we are keen to find a solution that would eradicate these problems, instead, enable us and everyone else to make some gains out of these situations. What we concluded after being through all of that journey and collecting facts around these: 
o	Whatever complex blockchain solution or advanced platform you may have, you still need adoption to make some profits for your investors.
o	Most investors (VC funds, private or retail) are only interested in their gains and not in the technology behind these assets however tps or consensus rule they may promise to deliver.
o	BTC movements will always ruin the party for you, you might own some very promising digital assets, but you still need a stable BTC to lock your gains, otherwise you’ll be stuck for another market cycle. 
For all the lost opportunities, missed Pre-sales and weekly swing trade moves, we designed Mutual to capture it all for everyone, every time. 

HOW?
The Mutual is not your typical index fund. Our architecture consists of different pools of funds, both automated and manually traded. We do not hold any baskets of digital assets as that exposes you to a lot of the risks we are working to avoid as fundamentals of this project. Here is the detail of our different pools and their working mechanism:
X1 
An automated Anti-market maker bot that hunts the liquidity on various assets but mostly BTC on leveraged trades. The Mutual team keep monitoring it along with the market conditions and render the settings accordingly. 
X2
This will be allocated to high performing Tokensets in collaboration with their creators for optimum performance as a stable steady growth and as a hedge against market movements, for more info regarding tokensets you may visit tokensets.com. We are not disclosing our chosen strategy here for obvious commercial reasons. 
X3
The Mutual, as a VC will take part in seed and private sales of cryptocurrency projects recommended by our due diligence team using the X3 funds. Also we pick up the coins from the reputable OTC markets before they’re listed on any exchange, cashing out the opportunity. As we aim to achieve the power of pooling, this is the best use case for Mutual, considering,
o	A lot of OTC sellers have minimum order limits which are hard to surpass by individual investor or small investors who want to hop on that train but miss out due to their limited investment.
o	For Investors who are willing to invest individually in our recommended projects (since all this information will be available to our community) on their own, Mutual will be partnering with some of the reputable and leading OTC and pool groups resulting in special access benefits for TMF holders. 
X4
Mutual will create an automatic lending pool based on Solana architecture, where users could lend & borrow stable TMFD against their crypto assets. In case of loan default, the pool shall automatically execute the refill function and a portion of assets shall be liquidated and will be added to the X4 pool value to stabilize the loan. 
X5
Mutual will develop an AMM & a yield aggregator similar to 1inch but for the upcoming Solana ecosystem, the yields of which, will be added to our pools. 

PERCENTILE DISTRIBUTION:
Here’s the percentile distribution of the total funds for each of the sub-funds. These are fixed after thoroughly reading the market trends and investment techniques. 
X1	10%
X2	30%
X3	30%
X4	20%
X5	10%
*-Percentages are subjected to change in future by voting among Mutual Governance Council



WORKING MECHANISM:
•	Once all our sales are closed, each sub-funds will be moved to their respective wallets already declared to our community and could be monitored easily.  
•	Our first Buy back & Burn program will be activated once one or more than one of our funds are up at least 10% from the initial value, but, this will not be dependent on the total 10% ROI as X-2 is a fund that depends on the ROI and acquisition of assets not in our control (Pre-sales tend to come in vesting) while X-1 & X-4 will be continuously in working. 
•	With 5% of the total profits on investment, TMF tokens will be market bought and an equal amount will be burned from the total supply. This will continue till 50% of the supply has been burned. The burn mechanism will be stopped after that and only market buying will keep on working.
•	Rest of 5% profits will be compounded equally back to all the funds equally.
Our goal is to keep TMF as simple and conventional as it is, for everyday investors and to keep it decoupled from the market specially BTC movements. We will keep the community updated of the amazing partnerships we have planned to bring up best use cases of TMF tokens. 

FAQ’s

Why do we buy TMF tokens, why not just use USDT instead?
Well, actually, with USDT, we won’t be able to distribute the benefits of collective fund to everyone out there around the globe by listing it on exchanges, neither it could be monitored by everyone nor will it open other ways of investment to the individual users. For a matter of fact, the world still doesn’t need Bitcoin and everything could be done easily with fiat. 
Why do we buy TMF? One can easily invest in these OTC and Pre-sales deals on their own?
Of course, some can, and most of the people cannot because of the minimum buying requirements, that’s where the power of pooling comes in play which we want to harness with this project. Also, with TMF token, we will be opening special access to these deals for people who want to invest in these projects on their own too, other than the TMF holding.
This looks very simple; how do we trust this? 
Investments should always be simple. That’s why we want to go to the basics, The Mutual Project is not another tech milestone, neither we in it for the tech. We are investors and we in it to make money for everyone who invest with us. The blockchain industry has grown many folds and already there’s a herd of different blockchains and platforms in the play, another one is not required in our opinion, all of these driven by one thing and ONE thing only, “ADOPTION”. If that is not happening, you can already see your investment going down the drain, while we believe most of us don’t even know, under these jargon technical terms, what are we actually investing in. The Mutual token works for itself, we do not need adoption, we create it. 
Some of the projects are already doing part of what is being done here, how do we compare?
There’s no harm in having multiple products of the same domain, it’s a free market and we believe we can combine the best of everything in here. 
Why TMF is not decentralized in its own system? Why it is not a DAO?
We at The Mutual project, do not believe in the concept of DAO’s in its current state, its decentralization principle is same as the democracy in some banana republic. So basically, one individual investor or group of investors having lots of funding power could overtake the whole network without any resistance? That’s something we do not want. Since we are investment and due diligence centric, it is totally against our interest if we hand over our investor’s funds control to the community which could be biased towards any decision, which may or may not turn out financially beneficial for everyone.
